"""Daily data archival and retention Celery task.

Runs once per day (via beat schedule) to:
1. Aggregate live data_point_series rows older than archive_after_days into daily archive.
2. Delete archive rows older than delete_after_days.

Both thresholds are configured by the admin via archival_settings.
If both are NULL, the task is a no-op.
